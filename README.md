# Used-Smartphone-Price-Analytics_D
Applying analytics and machine learning to support data-driven Price Prediction & Market Segmentation

Problem
The resale market for used smartphones often suffers from inconsistent pricing due to varying device features, condition, and market demand. This makes it difficult for sellers and platforms to determine fair prices and manage inventory effectively.

Approach
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand price drivers such as brand, storage, age, and condition
Cleaned and prepared data, handling missing values and outliers
Engineered features to better capture product and market characteristics
Applied predictive analytics using statistical and machine learning techniques to estimate device prices
Evaluated model performance to ensure reliability and generalization

Language: R
Methods: EDA, Regression Analysis, Tree-based Models (CART, Random Forest)
Evaluation: R², residual analysis
Concepts: Feature Engineering, Model Validation

Outcome
Achieved strong predictive performance (R² ~0.80)
Identified key features influencing resale price
Enabled data-driven pricing strategies and inventory tier classification, reducing pricing uncertainty
